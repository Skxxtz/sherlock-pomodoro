# Sherlock Pomodoro

This is a very lightweigt pomodoro timer built in rust for the usage with the
[Sherlock Application Launcher](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock). It listens
for socket messages to communicate with the Sherlock main process. Sherlock can then display the remaining time within the application.
